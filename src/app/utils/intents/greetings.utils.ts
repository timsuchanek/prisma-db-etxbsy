I keep track of all the things you do with your time, help you manage your goals and optimize the time wherever I can ‚è≥

Some examples:

1. Say "I was browsing from 7 PM to 9 PM today" or things like that in free-text and I will record the event for you.

2. Say "#feedback It would be great to have Chrome Extension support soon" and I will record your feedback (Make sure that you include the hashtag #feedback)

3. Say "#support I am unable to login to my account from yesterday" and I will record your support request (Make sure that you include the hashtag #support)

4. Saying "help" will bring up these tips again for you anytime.

I am learning by the day and will be able to do more soon.
